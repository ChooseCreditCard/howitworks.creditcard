          Before you compare rewards, lounges or cashback, it helps to understand the basics: what actually
          happens when you tap your card, how the bill is created, when interest starts and why minimum
          payments matter so much.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Credit Card, in Practice?</h2>
      <p>
        A credit card is a short-term borrowing line that you can use for purchases, online payments and
        sometimes cash withdrawals. Instead of paying immediately from your bank balance, the card issuer
        pays the merchant and you owe the issuer the amount later.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most cards follow a predictable pattern: a <strong>billing cycle</strong> (for example 30 days),
        a <strong>statement date</strong> where your total is calculated, and a
        <strong>due date</strong> where you must pay at least the minimum amount. If you pay the full
        statement balance on time, you normally avoid interest on purchases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding this basic rhythm – cycle, statement, due date – is the foundation for all other
        credit card topics.
      </p>

    <!-- Mechanics -->
    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>Key Steps in How a Credit Card Works</h2>
      <p>Even though the process is fast, several things happen each time you use your card:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Authorisation:</strong> The merchant sends a request to the card network (Visa, Mastercard,
          etc.) to check if your card is valid and if you have enough available credit.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Clearing &amp; settlement:</strong> The transaction is confirmed, and the issuer will pay
          the merchant via the network. You will see the transaction on your card account.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Billing:</strong> All your transactions during the cycle are grouped into a monthly
          statement that shows what you owe and the minimum amount to pay.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Repayment:</strong> You choose how much to pay. Paying the full statement amount usually
          avoids interest on purchases. Paying less triggers interest on the remaining balance.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Behind this, there are extra layers like <strong>FX conversion</strong> when you spend abroad,
        <strong>network fees</strong> and <strong>interchange</strong> between banks – but the user-facing
        experience stays relatively simple.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Costs & interest -->
    <section id="costs" class="section">
      <h2>Where the Costs Come From</h2>
      <p>
        Credit cards can be convenient and sometimes rewarding, but they are also complex financial products.
        Main cost sources include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>APR / interest rate:</strong> The yearly cost of carrying a balance. It is applied to any
          amount you do not pay in full by the due date.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Annual fees:</strong> Fixed yearly fees for having the card, sometimes in exchange for
          travel perks or insurance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>FX and cash withdrawal fees:</strong> Extra charges when you use the card abroad or take
          out cash from ATMs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Late fees:</strong> Penalties when you miss the due date or pay less than the minimum.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Because these elements interact, it can be hard to compare cards at a glance. That is why structured
        guides and comparison tables – like the ones on Choose.Creditcard – focus on breaking down each
        cost component clearly.
      </p>

    <!-- Using cards wisely -->
    <section id="usage" class="section">
      <h2>Using Credit Cards in a Smart, Controlled Way</h2>
      <p>
        You do not need to be an expert in finance to use a credit card responsibly. A few simple habits
        cover most everyday situations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Read at least the summary of key terms before you apply, especially APR, fees and FX costs.</li>
        <li>Set up reminders or automatic payments to avoid missed due dates and late fees.</li>
        <li>Try to pay the full statement balance whenever possible to reduce or avoid interest.</li>
        <li>Monitor your statements for unfamiliar charges and report suspicious activity quickly.</li>
        <li>Review once a year whether the card still fits your spending pattern and travel habits.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These basics apply to most markets, but local regulations, consumer protections and product
        details will always vary by country and issuer.
